Version 1.0.3

Fixed a bug in cellarray.cc where an iterator was used after it was 
invalidated (by calling erase()).

I removed useless includes of the <functional> header (aka
<tr1/functional) and four instances if "config.h" in headers that are
installed. Removed the test for tr1/functional in configure.ac.

Version 1.0.2

Updated a handful of files so that a C++-11 compiler won't gag. This
mostly means adding a compiler check for tr1/functional or functional.
There is still a problem with etc/hash_map versus the new
unordered_map. I added a test for unordered_map and use it if
available. It appears that unordered_map::rehash() is the same as
hash_map::resize(). the Grid class is abstract but did not declare its
destructor 'virtual'. All but one test pass and that test fails
without these changes (testaggregate) with an odd message from the
linking loader.

Version 1.0.1

Fixed configure.ac so it's possible to suppress building/linking with
netCDF. To do this, use --disable-netcdf.
