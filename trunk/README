== Directory structure ==

/src contains c++ source
/gridfield contains python bindings implemented using SWIG and python support modules
/gridfield_server is an XML-RPC server for evaluating remote gridfield expressions
/vistrails_package is a package for the VisTrails workflow system

== Requirements ==
Python 2.4+
swig 1.3+
netcdf 3+ (with headers)
VTK 4.2+ (optional, if vtk not detected through python, visualization components will not be built)

== Installation of the gridfield python package ==

Note: VTK headers are frequently installed in strange places.  
If you plan to use VTK, edit the setup.py file and change the value of vtkincl 

$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install


==== Installation of VisTrails Package ====

== Instructions ==

cp -LR vistrails_package/gridfield ~/.vistrails/userpackages
cp vistrails_package/examples/gridfieldexample.xml $VISTRAILS/examples

Enable the package in VisTrails:
Menu Edit > Preferences 
(Mac: Menu VisTrails > Preferences)

== Examples == 

A version tree showing how to use gridfields to 
access CORIE data is at vistrails_package/gridfieldexample.xml


== Build Instructions: Makefile ==

If you want to compile the library yourself (perhaps to compile bindings for a different language), you can modify the SWIG Makefile(s) in gridfield/ and the c++ Makefile in src/.

cd gridfield

# edit Makefile so that libraries and  include files
# for Python and VTK are correct.
# Also verify the compiler and associated settings. then:

make gridfield
make gfvis

# to test that gridfields can be imported in python, run
python test.py
# and verify that it generates simple output
